[MithralMist] Will Nefzen: [Talk] Aye 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] *nods slowly* [e] Aye. A gate is always integral to a good defense. Thankfully we have barricades, but a proper gate is desperately in need. 
Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] [Dw] True enough... But still, nay known him more than 2 minutes... 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] *glances to the side, attempting to peer beneath the hood* [e] Borderpost?
