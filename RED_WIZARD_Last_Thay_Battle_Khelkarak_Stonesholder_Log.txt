[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] Can't fight on an empty stomach, can we? 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] where is cruril? 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Looks at Celebrindal seriously] 
[sambuka] Dain Dain Torrun: [Talk] aye darkness will come soon enough lad 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] *looks to Hem* afraid not.. just some throwing weapons  
[rm] Varian Verner: [Talk] *seems to be napping, but has his mouth and nose covered* 
[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *grins slightly and chuckles softly* *C* Ah...your optimism is quite catchy...mind you still not convinced though....*rumbles through his belongings*...only if you take some cherries of the wodes 
[Kendaric Varkellen] Celebrindal Neldoreth: [Talk] From what direction do you expect his force to arrive? *flawless, melodic common* 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] any darts? 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] *glances at the sky with a melancholy sigh* [e] I was just thinking about several things....foremost at the moment, remembering my defense of the fortress against the gnoll hordes and recalling the bitter rain... 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [smiles] Certainly. 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Elvish] I am the Nikerym brother. 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] Nothing and a half. 
[Manesis] Ando Hazuk: [Talk] *smiling widely* 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] [e] ...thinking that perhaps a hood would be beneficial  in this battle, so the rain and sodden hair does not disrupt my aim. 
[Manesis] Ando Hazuk: [Talk] Don't worry, we're going to win. 
[Ilmare] Arenel Ithil'ina: [Talk] *shifts her gaze to Lenir* 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Elvish] If you speak of our Arato then I do not know, [frowns and looks slightly worried] 
[Manesis] Ando Hazuk: [Talk] The waters speak of a kind fate 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] can you use these? 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Looks offended] 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] Believe you me, I have my sad moments.  But I already live on an isle once called by a woman the "Isle of Loss", so I see no reason to add to the sadness. 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] shakes head* i have never seen those before. 
[Manesis] Ando Hazuk: [Talk] Don't worry, we will have victory. 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] oh..

[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *C* Hmm....met the lady i did perhaps? 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [eats a baked potato of his own, bit by bit] 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Elvish]  You may compare yourself to a...man, [Looks displeased], but do not compare our Arato to one brother. 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] [g] Hem, what did he show you? 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] great... 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] I knew not her name, and have not seen her in a long time. 
[rm] Varian Verner: [Talk] *stirs slightly* 
[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *rubs the potato to his cloak and blows on it before munching on it slowly* 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] some kind of star lookin thingies. 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] Hmm. 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Elvish]  He is an Elf, one of our creators chosen.  He holds in him the beauty and emotions of the Seldarine. 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] ill just have to use these... *holds fists up and shadow boxes* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] Well, Darkness, when last we spoke you intended to show me all that is sad and not joyous.  Now seems as good a time as any. [smirks slightly] 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] *nods to Cruril* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [speaks in firm, steady tones] 
Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] *frowns* *Dw* How long be this gonna be taking? Ain't right for the High Sonnlinor to be away from kin in a situation like this...

[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] I have an idea. 
[cstender] Cruril Silvershaper: [Talk] *listens* 
[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* I doubt he has much choice, Barakor...

[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *taps his chin once more and mumbles* *C* Hmm...quite...yet let me know the face of my newest addition to my circle of friends first...*slowly starts to extands his hands* 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] *sheaths the blade*

[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* For that ritual or whatever they do 
Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] *Dw* Do nay be making it any more right... *grumbles* 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Looks displeased and averts her eyes elsewhere] 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Stands proudly] 
[sambuka] Dain Dain Torrun: [Talk] *nods* 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] [gnomish] They wont see me coming... *grins* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [guides the Elf's hands to his face]

Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] *nods slowly* 
[drew_panda] Hem Understone: [Talk] excuse me sir? 
[cstender] Cruril Silvershaper: [Talk] [g] Chuckles*  Hopefully not...but if we all stick together hopefully we'll have a better chance. 
[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *nods sagely as he slowly probes your face, nodding sagely as it ends with your chin* C* Hmm....strangely enough....your quite what i expected....*grins slightly* 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] *nods* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] Oh?  I hope you expected good things then. 
[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* I dearly hope their battleplan involves something better than a mass charge 
[Junglist123] Sel'ae Lylth: [Talk] [Elvish] Wonderful elder, you will always be of use to the people for you are one of them. 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] Prun? *pokes at him with his foot* 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] *growls* (speaking in a low guttural tone) <I grow impatient....when will the ritual finish? It is taking far too long...> 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] [e] 
[Ilmare] Arenel Ithil'ina: [Talk] *e* your wisdom and skill would be welcome elder 
[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* But from the looks of it I think that's what they plan 
[sambuka] Dain Dain Torrun: [Talk] dwarven wouldnae bet on it Baraz lad 
[bredbergen] Cane Wallace: [Talk] hm. 
[Shinamori_Aoshi] Lillith Nighsong: [Talk] *taps his chin slightly* *C* Hmm...somehow I hoped you had a dour face to give me the right in the matter we have..but i am sadely dissapointed in that...*grins slightly* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [brushes some hair from his face] 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] [chuckles lightly] 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] *tosses his head to clear his bangs from his eyes* 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] I have had a sad face in times past.  And a troubled face in times recent.  But today, I have a joyous face. 
Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] *Dw* We just need to be focusing on kin, first. They can do what they be liking, but we be knowing how we wage war. 
[cstender] Cruril Silvershaper: [Talk] Hem let's see if we can find you a club or something to swing 
[sambuka] Dain Dain Torrun: [Talk] *dw* be askin fool question, what it be like in tha North what he think it be like*grumbles*

[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* yes, barakor. As long as they don't get in our way.... 
[Kebril Di'makiir] Kebril Dimakiir: [Talk] (quietly, in normal tones) [e] I merely hope she is safe. 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] *slides them back* 
[-The Dragon-] Maranadil  Tyr'llenus: [Talk] *nods* e-I hope she is well... *sighs* 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] *switches the dagger with a shortsword* 
[Ronnie Soak] Baraz Stronghammer: [Talk] *in dwarven* Well, let's hope the likes of him keep out from there now 
[Mo_Steel] Wesley Briamson: [Talk] Either we are victorious, and we should have a celebration fit for ten battles, or we will perish, and be with our Gods and Goddesses in peace. 
[cstender] Cruril Silvershaper: [Talk] Well that will work...thank you sir 
Khelkarak Stoneshoulder: [Talk] *grunts* *Dw* Carven were having fun with that lad last time we were down here... Carven be the reason dwarves be so misunderstood, I reckon... 
[-Emerald Sword-] Frigo Plinwelk: [Talk] *hands Hem a dagger with his teeth*
